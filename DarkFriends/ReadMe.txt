    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : DarkFriends Project Overview
========================================================================

This Disables ALL P2P traffic in Dark Souls that isn't directed to an
identity on your friends list. This results in 0 invasions and nobody 
playing with you except people on your friends list. This will likely
piss off the community, so don't use this ;)

VAC:
Dll injection itself is not grounds for a VAC ban. This functions 
similarly to GeDoSoTa in that they both inject dll's and hook functions.
DarkFriends however hooks Steam API functions instead of d3d calls, which
may look more suspicious but VAC as offered by steamworks does not have
automatic detection: Bamco has to contact Valve to report a cheat and
for it's signature to be added to VAC.
